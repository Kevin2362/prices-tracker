# prices-tracker

To track the prices of cryptocurrencies, you can use a Python script with the requests library to fetch data from a cryptocurrency price API. For this example, we'll use the CoinGecko API, which provides cryptocurrency price data.

Make sure you have Python installed, and you can install the requests library using pip:
  pip install requests
  
Run the script using the following command:
  python crypto_tracker.py
